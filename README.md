README POM Matlab processing

This repository contains MATLAB code to generate 3D panoramic optical mapping (POM) data. Please see the POMprocessing file for instructions on how to utilize the Rhythm code generated by the Efimov laboratory to generate 2D activation, APD, and phase maps.

Our 3D POM algorithm as described in Melki et al. is detailed in the file "PanoramicOpticalMapping_UserGuidePierre". 

RhythmDevelopment1 contains the modified Rhythm code from the Efimov laboratory required to generate 2D activation, APD, and phase maps. 
PanoramicImagingGUIv10 contains the 3D panoramic optical mapping code.
Registration-Thickness contains code to coregister micro-CT and 3D POM data.

Code for machine learning segmentation of microCT data is held in separate GitHub repository "MicroCTsegmentation"
